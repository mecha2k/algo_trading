This repo provides a growing collection of Jupyter&reg; notebooks that will bring to life the topics covered in our book. 
They will providing practical examples and usable code to help the reader extract maximum value from the material.

It also provides guided exercises, again as notebooks, to allow students to deepen their understanding through hands on practice. 
  
We are actively working on this repo and it's not ready for usage just now. Please check in a few weeks to see if the repo is ready. 
We are all full time professionals and unfortunately don't have a lot of time so we apologize for being beind schedule with this.

We are working as hard as we can and we'll have it done as soon as possible.
